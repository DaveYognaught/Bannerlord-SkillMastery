A Game Mod I made for Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord.
Published on Nexus.

This mod allows you to unlock all perks for a skill, provided you have put the time, the effort and the focus / attribute investment into leveling that skill.
This is unlike "Double Perk" mods that remove agency or a decision at low levels. You will not receive extra perks until you have earnt them!
Continue developing your mastered skill(s).

First ever mod. Made and published in a single night more or less with some additional great improvements from inspired and thankful commentors. 
Played a lot with the mod until I ultimately played 2 full length campaigns and exhausted all I could from the game. :D
